## Why Virtual Routes Matter

Indoor cycling doesn't have to mean staring at a blank wall. The right route video transforms your workout from a chore into an adventure. Whether you're grinding through a 45-minute session on your spinning bike or doing a recovery ride on your old ergometer, having a beautiful road ahead of you makes all the difference.

With CycleRun, your webcam tracks your cadence and adjusts the video speed in real-time — no smart trainer or expensive sensors needed. Here are the routes our community loved most in early 2026.

## 1. Mallorca — Cap de Formentor

**Distance:** 18 km | **Elevation:** 340m | **Difficulty:** Moderate

The iconic road to the lighthouse at Cap de Formentor is a bucket-list ride for every cyclist. Dramatic cliff-side roads, turquoise water below, and just enough climbing to keep your legs honest. The final descent rewards you with one of the most beautiful coastal views in Europe.

**Best for:** Intermediate riders looking for a scenic challenge.

## 2. Stelvio Pass — Italy

**Distance:** 24 km | **Elevation:** 1,800m | **Difficulty:** Hard

48 hairpin turns. 1,800 meters of climbing. The Stelvio is one of the highest paved passes in the Alps and a monument of cycling history. The POV video from the eastern approach (Prato side) is absolutely mesmerizing — each switchback reveals a new panorama.

**Best for:** Climbers and endurance enthusiasts who want to suffer beautifully.

## 3. Pacific Coast Highway — California

**Distance:** 35 km | **Elevation:** 120m | **Difficulty:** Easy

Flat, scenic, and endlessly beautiful. The stretch between Big Sur and Monterey offers ocean views, towering cliffs, and that golden California light. Perfect for a recovery ride or a long, steady session.

**Best for:** Beginners and anyone who wants to zone out and enjoy the scenery.

## 4. Lake Garda Loop — Italy

**Distance:** 28 km | **Elevation:** 450m | **Difficulty:** Moderate

The western shore of Lake Garda, from Limone to Riva del Garda, is a cycling paradise. Tunnels carved into rock, Mediterranean vegetation, and the deep blue lake always beside you. The route has some punchy climbs but nothing too long.

**Best for:** Mixed-terrain lovers who enjoy variety.

## 5. Trollstigen — Norway

**Distance:** 12 km | **Elevation:** 850m | **Difficulty:** Hard

Norway's famous "Troll Road" — a series of dramatic switchbacks climbing through fjord country. Waterfalls, mist, and raw Scandinavian nature. Short but intense, and the scenery is otherworldly.

**Best for:** Adventure seekers and anyone who loves dramatic landscapes.

## 6. Provence Lavender Fields — France

**Distance:** 30 km | **Elevation:** 200m | **Difficulty:** Easy

Rolling hills through endless purple lavender fields in southern France. The gentle gradients and pastoral scenery make this ideal for Zone 2 training. Pure relaxation on two wheels.

**Best for:** Recovery rides and long, steady efforts.

## 7. Alpe d'Huez — France

**Distance:** 14 km | **Elevation:** 1,070m | **Difficulty:** Very Hard

The most famous climb in cycling. 21 numbered hairpins, each painted on the road. Every Tour de France fan needs to ride this at least once. The gradient averages 8% but kicks up to 13% in places.

**Best for:** Serious climbers testing their limits.

## 8. Kyoto Temple Circuit — Japan

**Distance:** 22 km | **Elevation:** 180m | **Difficulty:** Easy

A unique cultural ride through Kyoto's temple district. Bamboo forests, ancient shrines, cherry blossom paths. Completely different from European mountain routes — a refreshing change of scenery for your indoor sessions.

**Best for:** Anyone looking for something different and culturally rich.

## 9. Ring of Kerry — Ireland

**Distance:** 40 km | **Elevation:** 380m | **Difficulty:** Moderate

Ireland's most famous scenic drive, adapted for cycling. Green hills, stone walls, Atlantic coastline, and that uniquely Irish light that painters have tried to capture for centuries. Long and varied — perfect for an endurance session.

**Best for:** Long-distance riders who want a full 60+ minute session.

## 10. Tenerife — Mount Teide Approach

**Distance:** 32 km | **Elevation:** 1,400m | **Difficulty:** Hard

The volcanic roads of Tenerife leading up toward Mount Teide. Above the cloud line, the landscape turns alien — red volcanic rock, clear skies, and thin air. Many pro teams train here, and for good reason.

**Best for:** Pro-level training simulation with unique scenery.

## Why GoPro Settings Matter for Indoor Cycling

When you record a POV cycling video for platforms like CycleRun, the viewing experience depends heavily on your camera settings. Too much motion blur? Riders get nauseous. Wrong field of view? The road feels disconnected. Bad stabilization? Unwatchable.

This guide covers the exact settings we recommend for GoPro Hero 12, 13, and earlier models.

## Resolution: 1080p is the Sweet Spot

You might be tempted to shoot in 4K. Don't — unless you have unlimited storage and fast upload speeds.

- **1080p (1920×1080)** — Perfect balance of quality and file size. Streams smoothly on all devices. Recommended.
- **2.7K** — Slightly sharper, but files are 40% larger. Only if you plan to crop or stabilize in post.
- **4K** — Overkill for indoor cycling. Files are massive (400MB/minute), and the visual improvement on a laptop screen is negligible.

**Our recommendation: 1080p, always.**

## Frame Rate: 30fps vs 60fps

- **30fps** — Smooth, natural motion. Smaller file sizes. This is what broadcast TV uses. **Recommended for cycling videos.**
- **60fps** — Smoother but files are 2x larger. Only useful if you want slow-motion capability in post. Most viewers won't notice the difference during a cycling session.

**Our recommendation: 30fps.**

## Stabilization: The Most Important Setting

This is the single most important setting. A shaky cycling video is unwatchable.

### GoPro Hero 12/13
- **HyperSmooth 6.0**: Set to **HIGH** or **BOOST**. Boost crops the image slightly more but eliminates virtually all vibration.

### GoPro Hero 10/11
- **HyperSmooth 5.0**: Set to **HIGH**. Boost is available but more aggressive.

### GoPro Hero 8/9
- **HyperSmooth 3.0/4.0**: Set to **ON** or **HIGH**.

### Older Models (Hero 5-7)
- No built-in stabilization. Use **ReelSteady GO** in post-production ($100, but worth it for serious creators).

**Our recommendation: Stabilization on HIGH minimum. BOOST if available.**

## Field of View (FOV)

The FOV determines how wide the image is.

- **Wide** — Shows the road, handlebars, and surrounding scenery. Immersive feel. **Recommended.**
- **SuperView** — Even wider. Great for chest mounts. Can look slightly distorted at edges.
- **Linear** — Removes fisheye distortion but feels less immersive. Good for front-facing shots.
- **Narrow** — Too zoomed in for cycling. Don't use this.

**Our recommendation: Wide or SuperView.**

## Color Profile

- **Natural/Standard** — Accurate colors, ready to use without editing. **Recommended.**
- **Flat** — Desaturated, designed for color grading in post. Only for advanced editors.
- **Vivid** — Over-saturated. Can look artificial. Avoid.

## Mounting Position

The mount affects the viewing angle more than any setting.

### Chest Mount (Recommended)
- Most natural POV perspective
- Shows the handlebars for depth reference
- Minimal vibration (body absorbs shocks)
- Camera angle: **Tilt up about 15-20°** so it looks at the road ahead, not straight down

### Handlebar Mount
- Steadier image on smooth roads
- More vibration on rough surfaces
- Feels less immersive (missing body context)
- Good for mountain bikes with front suspension

### Helmet Mount
- Very immersive but picks up head movements
- Can be distracting and cause motion sickness
- Only use with maximum stabilization

**Our recommendation: Chest mount with 15-20° upward tilt.**

## Audio Settings

- **Wind Noise Reduction: ON**
- Record ambient sound (road noise, nature, breathing) — riders find it more immersive than silence
- **Do NOT add music** — riders play their own playlists

## GPS Settings

**Turn GPS ON.** This records a GPX track alongside your video.

Why it matters:
- CycleRun can use GPS elevation data to simulate inclines
- Automatic route mapping and difficulty calculation
- Speed synchronization between video and real-world pace

Export GPX from GoPro Quik app or use the \`gopro2gpx\` command-line tool.

## Export Settings for Upload

## The Indoor Cycling Landscape in 2026

Indoor cycling has exploded. Millions train at home on spinning bikes, ergometers, and home trainers. Zwift dominates the market, but its high cost and hardware requirements leave many riders looking for alternatives.

CycleRun takes a fundamentally different approach. Let's compare them honestly.

## Cost Comparison

| | CycleRun | Zwift |
|---|---|---|
| **Monthly Fee** | Free — forever | €17.99/month (€215/year) |
| **Hardware Required** | Any webcam | Smart trainer (€300-1,500) |
| **Minimum Investment** | €0 | €500+ |
| **Premium Features** | Free | Included in subscription |

**Bottom line:** CycleRun costs nothing. Zwift costs at minimum €500 for a smart trainer plus €215/year for the subscription. Over 3 years, that's **€1,145** vs **€0**.

## Hardware Requirements

### CycleRun
- Any computer or laptop with a webcam
- Any home trainer (spinning bike, ergometer, even a 20-year-old exercise bike)
- No sensors, no ANT+, no Bluetooth needed
- Your webcam's camera detects your leg movement

### Zwift
- Smart trainer (Wahoo KICKR, Tacx Neo, etc.) — €300-1,500
- OR: "Dumb" trainer + speed/cadence sensors + ANT+ dongle — €100-200
- Computer, Apple TV, or iPad
- Heart rate monitor (recommended)
- Power meter (recommended for accurate data)

**Winner: CycleRun** — Works with equipment you already own.

## How They Work

### CycleRun: Camera-Based Motion Detection
Your webcam films your legs while you pedal. AI-powered motion detection measures your cadence (RPM) in real-time. The video you're riding to speeds up or slows down based on your effort. All processing happens locally in your browser — no images are transmitted.

### Zwift: Sensor-Based Virtual World
Your smart trainer or sensors transmit power, speed, and cadence data via ANT+ or Bluetooth. You ride in a 3D virtual world with other riders. Resistance changes automatically on smart trainers.

## Features Comparison

| Feature | CycleRun | Zwift |
|---|---|---|
| Real-world POV videos | ✅ | ❌ (3D virtual world) |
| Free to use | ✅ | ❌ (€17.99/mo) |
| No smart trainer needed | ✅ | ❌ |
| Works with any home trainer | ✅ | Limited |
| Multiplayer racing | ❌ (coming soon) | ✅ |
| Training plans | ❌ (coming soon) | ✅ |
| Power measurement | ❌ (estimated) | ✅ (accurate) |

| Offline capability | ✅ (with local video) | ❌ |
| Gamification | ✅ (achievements, share cards) | ✅ (levels, badges, drops) |
| Community routes | ✅ (creator marketplace) | ❌ (fixed routes) |

## When to Choose CycleRun

- **You have a basic home trainer** without smart capabilities
- **You don't want to spend money** on a smart trainer or subscription
- **You prefer real-world scenery** over virtual 3D worlds
- **Privacy matters to you** — no cloud processing
- **You want to ride real roads** like Mallorca, the Alps, or coastal highways
- **You're a casual rider** who wants a better indoor experience without complexity

## When to Choose Zwift

- **You already own a smart trainer** and want to maximize it
- **Competitive racing matters** — Zwift has a huge racing community
- **You need accurate power data** for structured training
- **Social riding with friends** in real-time is important
- **Structured training plans** with ERG mode

## Can You Use Both?

Absolutely. Many riders use CycleRun for scenic rides and recovery sessions, and Zwift for structured interval training and races. They serve different purposes.

## The Bigger Picture

Zwift revolutionized indoor cycling by making it social and gamified. But it created a high barrier to entry: expensive hardware and a monthly subscription.

CycleRun democratizes indoor cycling. If you have a bike that moves and a computer with a webcam, you're in. No financial barrier. No hardware barrier. Just ride.

The future of indoor cycling isn't one platform — it's choice. And CycleRun gives you a compelling free option that didn't exist before.
