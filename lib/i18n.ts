    // FAQ
    "faq.title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq.q1": "Is CycleRun really free?",
    "faq.a1": "Yes, CycleRun is completely free to use. No subscription, no premium version, no hidden costs. You just need a webcam and a browser.",
    "faq.q2": "Which devices are compatible?",
    "faq.a2": "CycleRun works with any home trainer where legs move visibly: spinning bikes, ergometers, old home trainers, indoor bikes — even devices without Bluetooth or smart features. Running mode for treadmills is in development.",
    "faq.q3": "How does it work without sensors?",
    "faq.a3": "Your webcam detects your leg movement using AI-powered image analysis. You place detection zones over your knees or pedals — the software automatically recognizes your cadence. All processing runs locally in your browser.",
    "faq.q4": "How is this different from Zwift or Rouvy?",
    "faq.a4": "Zwift requires a smart trainer (from €300) and costs €17.99/month. Rouvy is similar. CycleRun is free and only uses your webcam — ideal if you want to upgrade your existing home trainer without investing in expensive hardware.",
    "faq.q5": "Are my webcam images stored?",
    "faq.a5": "No. All image processing happens exclusively locally in your browser. No images or videos are transmitted to our servers. Your privacy matters to us.",
    "faq.q6": "Can I use my old ergometer?",
    "faq.a6": "Yes! Whether your ergometer is 5 or 25 years old — as long as your legs move, CycleRun detects the motion. No smart trainer or sensors needed.",

    "faq.title": "Häufige Fragen",
    "faq.q1": "Ist CycleRun wirklich kostenlos?",
    "faq.a1": "Ja, CycleRun ist vollständig kostenlos nutzbar. Kein Abo, keine Premium-Version, keine versteckten Kosten. Du brauchst nur eine Webcam und einen Browser.",
    "faq.q2": "Welche Geräte sind kompatibel?",
    "faq.a2": "CycleRun funktioniert mit jedem Heimtrainer, bei dem sich Beine sichtbar bewegen: Spinning-Bikes, Ergometer, alte Heimtrainer, Indoor Bikes — auch Geräte ohne Bluetooth oder Smart-Funktionen. Der Running-Modus für Laufbänder ist in Entwicklung.",
    "faq.q3": "Wie funktioniert das ohne Sensoren?",
    "faq.a3": "Deine Webcam erkennt die Bewegung deiner Beine per KI-gestützter Bildanalyse. Du platzierst Erkennungszonen über deinen Knien oder Pedalen — die Software erkennt automatisch deine Trittfrequenz. Die gesamte Verarbeitung läuft lokal in deinem Browser.",
    "faq.q4": "Was ist der Unterschied zu Zwift oder Rouvy?",
    "faq.a4": "Zwift erfordert einen Smart Trainer (ab €300) und kostet €17,99/Monat. Rouvy ähnlich. CycleRun ist kostenlos und nutzt nur deine Webcam — ideal, wenn du deinen vorhandenen Heimtrainer aufwerten möchtest, ohne in teure Hardware zu investieren.",
    "faq.q5": "Werden meine Webcam-Bilder gespeichert?",
    "faq.a5": "Nein. Die gesamte Bildverarbeitung findet ausschließlich lokal in deinem Browser statt. Es werden keine Bilder oder Videos an unsere Server übertragen. Deine Privatsphäre ist uns wichtig.",
    "faq.q6": "Kann ich mein altes Ergometer verwenden?",
    "faq.a6": "Ja! Egal ob dein Ergometer 5 oder 25 Jahre alt ist — solange sich deine Beine bewegen, erkennt CycleRun die Bewegung. Du brauchst keinen Smart Trainer und keine Sensoren.",
